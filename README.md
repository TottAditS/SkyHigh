<h3>About This Project</h3>
<p align="justify">This project was developed to simulate real-world realism using Unity's 3D High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP), focusing on advanced lighting, shadows, and reflections to achieve high-quality visuals. The primary goal is to explore and implement features such as realistic materials, detailed environmental effects, and dynamic lighting systems. These features allow for a deeper immersion in virtual environments and showcase the visual capabilities of Unity HDRP.</p>

<h3>Game Description</h3>
<p align="justify">The game is designed as a realistic urban simulation, taking place in a modern city environment. Players can explore the city streets, interact with various objects, and experience a world where time and weather dynamically change, affecting the atmosphere and lighting in real-time. Through this simulation, the game demonstrates advanced environmental rendering techniques that bring a new level of visual fidelity to gameplay.

<h3>Target Gameplay</h3>
<p align="justify">The game aims to provide a visually immersive experience that highlights exploration and observation. Players can navigate through the city, witnessing the detailed architecture and environmental changes as they interact with the urban setting. The focus is on delivering an experience where players can feel the realism of the world around them through high-quality graphics and smooth performance, thanks to HDRP.</p>

# Game Mechanics I Created

<h3>Occlusion and LOD Optimization (Underway)</h3>
<p align="justify">Occlusion culling and Level of Detail (LOD) optimization techniques are actively being developed to enhance performance without sacrificing visual quality. By dynamically adjusting the level of detail based on the player's distance from objects, and by occluding non-visible objects from rendering, the system ensures that the game runs smoothly even in highly detailed scenes.</p>

<h3>aHDRP Advanced PostProcessing</h3>
<p align="justify">Advanced post-processing techniques have been implemented to elevate the game's visual appeal. Features like bloom, depth of field, motion blur, and color grading are finely tuned to create a cinematic atmosphere that enhances the overall gameplay experience. These effects allow the game to simulate real-life camera behaviors, adding another layer of realism.</p>

<h3>What I Learned</h3>
<p align="justify">This project provided valuable insights into the HDRP's capabilities and how to optimize complex environments for performance. I learned how to effectively implement advanced lighting techniques, optimize shaders and materials, and utilize post-processing to create visually stunning results. Additionally, I gained experience in performance optimization through occlusion culling and LOD systems, which are crucial for maintaining smooth gameplay in high-fidelity environments.</p>
